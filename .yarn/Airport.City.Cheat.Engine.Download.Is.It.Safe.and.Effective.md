But what is a cheat engine and how does it work? A cheat engine is a software tool that allows you to modify the memory of a game or application while it is running. You can use it to change the values of certain variables, such as your money, energy, or items. For example, you can use a cheat engine to scan for the value of your coins in Airport City, then change it to a higher amount. This way, you can buy anything you want in the game without spending real money.
 
However, using a cheat engine is not without risks. First of all, it is illegal and unethical to use a cheat engine on a game that involves online features or transactions. You are violating the terms of service of the game developer and publisher, and you may face legal consequences or account bans. Secondly, using a cheat engine may damage your device or expose it to malware. Some cheat engines may contain viruses or spyware that can harm your device or steal your personal information.
